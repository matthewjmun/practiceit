/*
Write a method named binaryZeros that accepts an integer n as a parameter and returns the number of zeros that occur in the binary representation of n. For example, the call of binaryZeros(44) returns 3 because the binary representation of 44 is 101100, which contains three zeros. You may assume that n is non-negative.
