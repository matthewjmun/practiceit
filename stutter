/*
Write a method stutter that takes an ArrayList of Strings as a parameter and that replaces every string with two of that string. For example, if the list stores the values {"how", "are", "you?"} before the method is called, it should store the values {"how", "how", "are", "are", "you?", "you?"} after the method finishes executing.
